# 🏡 House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

A complete machine learning pipeline to predict house prices based on key features such as area, location, number of rooms, and more. This project uses the [Kaggle House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) and demonstrates an end-to-end regression workflow — from data preprocessing to model evaluation and visualization.

## 📍 Overview

Predicting real estate prices is a classic regression problem in machine learning. This project guides you through:
- Loading and cleaning real-world housing data
- Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Handling missing values and encoding categorical features
- Training and evaluating a Linear Regression model
- Visualizing predicted vs actual values

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- ✅ Understand and apply basic regression techniques
- ✅ Perform data cleaning and preprocessing on real datasets
- ✅ Evaluate models using RMSE and visualizations
- ✅ Build a reproducible and professional ML project
